            <p>With our first assignment, we were meant to show our recently developed skills in the most basic of html code. We showed this by creating a simple website based on whatever topic we wanted and for this assignment, I decided to delve into how scary our planet's oceans are compared to space.</p>

        <p>This second assignment now takes us away from the basics of html, but instead to its' counterpart...CSS styles. Here we applied the basic system of making a website look "pretty" and easier on the eye. With the use of classes, divs, and id's, we were able to make not only our 2nd assignment pretty, but also our homepage.
