       <h2>Assignments</h2>

       <div class="column">
        <div id="assign1">
            <p class="linklight"><a href="assignments/01-BasicHTML/index.html">Basic HTML</a></p>

            <p>With our first assignment, we were meant to show our recently developed skills in the most basic of html code. We showed this by creating a simple website based on whatever topic we wanted and for this assignment, I decided to delve into how scary our planet's oceans are compared to space.</p>
       
        </div>
        <div id="assign2">
        <p class="linklight"><a href="assignments/02-BasicCSS/index.html">Basic CSS</a></p>
        <img src="images/assignment2.png" alt="Assignment 2" style="width: 300; height: 150;" class="center">
        <p>This second assignment now takes us away from the basics of html, but instead to its' counterpart...CSS styles. Here we applied the basic system of making a website look "pretty" and easier on the eye. With the use of classes, divs, and id's, we were able to make not only our 2nd assignment pretty, but also our homepage.

         <div id="assign3">
        <p class="linklight"><a href="assignments/03-FlexBox/index.html">FlexBox</a></p>
        <img src="images/assignment3.png" alt="Assignment 3" style="width: 300; height: 150;" class="center">
        <p>This third assignment was to demonstrate that we as student can somewhat understand how to use flex box since our next assignment is purely flexbox use. While using these skills is definitely difficult, I know mastering it now wil make the future much much easier.

        <div id="assign4">
        <p class="linklight"><a href="assignments/04-Layout/index.html">Recreating CSS</a></p>
        <img src="images/assignment4.png" alt="Assignment 4" style="width: 300; height: 150;" class="center">
        <p>This is by far the hardest assignment so far in CSCE242 as we now had to use our recent knowledge of css layout to recreate a page of our universities Nursing department. I had a lot of trouble with this one but I fully understand how to use flex box and properly set up media queries properly.
        </p>

        <div id="assign5">
        <p class="linklight"><a href="assignments/05-JavaScript/index.html">JavaScript</a></p>
        <img src="images/assignment5.png" alt="Assignment 5" style="width: 300; height: 150;" class="center">
        <p>This assignment was to showcase our understanding of java script and its different uses. Of course this is only a small example but I'm already starting personal projects of my own to utilize different aspects of java. The calendar java aspect is probably the most important out of the ones showcased here and will most definitely be used in my own project.

        <div id="assign6">
        <p class="linklight"><a href="assignments/06-ToggleMenu/index.html">Toggle Menu</a></p>
        <img src="images/assignment6.png" alt="Assignment 6" style="width: 300; height: 150;" class="center">
        <p>In this assignment we are still working with javascript but now we are going way more indepth with it and having more java code to write. In this assignment we had to code a range slider, date() counter, and a good bit of listening events. The toggle menu function was the star of the show however as we will be using these in our actual websites.

            <p>I wanted to make my website with a very clean, blue, minimalistic feel to it. The design focuses on a holistic health approach, utilizing a three-column layout to highlight core pillars like strength training, nutrition, and body assessments.
