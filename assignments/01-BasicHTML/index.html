        <h2 style="font-family:Times"><em>Actively Nuturing <strong>and Terrifying</strong></em></h2>
        <p>The ocean is often seen as scarier than space because it's a vast, unexplored, yet close environment filled with tangible, active threats like venomous creatures, immense pressure, and sudden storms, unlike space where dangers (vacuum, radiation) are more passive and we're generally protected by advanced tech, making the ocean feel more immediate and primal to the human psyche. In space, danger is expected. You already know it’s hostile. In the ocean, danger hides behind beauty. Calm water can turn violent. Clear water can conceal predators, riptides, drop-offs, and massive unseen depths. It tricks your brain into feeling safe.</p>

        <p>Space is vast and unknown, but it’s distant. The ocean is an unknown that exists beneath our feet, surrounding our continents, touching our lives. You can accidentally fall into it. You can be swallowed by it in seconds. That closeness makes it feel more real and more threatening.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family:Verdana">Why you should be more Scared of the Ocean than Space</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Unknown Creatures: The deep sea hosts alien-looking predators with specialized senses (like bioluminescence) and powerful jaws, actively hunting in the dark. </li>
            <li>Physical Dangers: Crushing pressure, lack of oxygen, venom, flesh-eating bacteria, and rogue waves present immediate threats. </li>
            <li>Unexplored Territory: Only 5% explored, it feels like a giant, close-by alien world hiding untold horrors, playing on our fear of the unknown. </li>
            <li>Primal Fear: Ancient instincts link open water to danger; drowning or being attacked from below is a deeply ingrained fear. </li>
        </ol>
