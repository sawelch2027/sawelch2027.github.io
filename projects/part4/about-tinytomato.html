        <p>By day, I’m a college student at the University of South Carolina, working toward my bachelor’s degree in Computer Information Science while training to become a sailor in the U.S. Navy. But by night, I’m an undercover artist, constantly creating and sharing my work with the world. Drawing has always been my escape—a way to unwind, express myself, and relieve stress. But beyond art, I also love working out, running, and getting lost in music. I created this website as a space for anyone looking to explore a new creative outlet, pick up a stress-relieving hobby, and simply have fun making art. Whether you're a seasoned artist or just picking up a pencil for the first time, there’s always something new to try and discover. Creativity has no limits, and the best part is that there’s no right or wrong way to make art. So grab your favorite sketchbook, experiment fearlessly, and enjoy the process. I’m always open to new ideas and can’t wait to see where this journey takes us. Let’s create something amazing together!

   <p> I love spending hours digitally drawing, bringing my ideas to life with every stroke of my stylus. With a Diet Coke always within reach, I find inspiration in the little details, whether it's the way light falls on a character's face or the flow of fabric in motion. One of my biggest artistic inspirations is AnnaLaura_art on Instagram. Her work never fails to spark my creativity and admiration. Whether I'm sketching for fun or refining a new piece, art is my favorite way to express myself. I also love experimenting with different styles and techniques, always pushing myself to improve and try something new. Some days, I focus on dynamic poses and anatomy, while other times, I get lost in the details of shading and textures. No matter what I’m working on, I enjoy the process just as much as the final result. Art is a journey, and every piece teaches me something—whether it’s patience, problem-solving, or simply appreciating the progress I’ve made. It’s a constant learning experience, and that’s what makes it so exciting.</p>
