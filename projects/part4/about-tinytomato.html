        <p>By day, Iâ€™m a college student at the University of South Carolina, working toward my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Information Science while training to become a sailor in the U.S. Navy. But by night, Iâ€™m an undercover artist, constantly creating and sharing my work with the world. Drawing has always been my escapeâ€”a way to unwind, express myself, and relieve stress. But beyond art, I also love working out, running, and getting lost in music. I created this website as a space for anyone looking to explore a new creative outlet, pick up a stress-relieving hobby, and simply have fun making art. Whether you're a seasoned artist or just picking up a pencil for the first time, thereâ€™s always something new to try and discover. Creativity has no limits, and the best part is that thereâ€™s no right or wrong way to make art. So grab your favorite sketchbook, experiment fearlessly, and enjoy the process. Iâ€™m always open to new ideas and canâ€™t wait to see where this journey takes us. Letâ€™s create something amazing together!

   <p> I love spending hours digitally drawing, bringing my ideas to life with every stroke of my stylus. With a Diet Coke always within reach, I find inspiration in the little details, whether it's the way light falls on a character's face or the flow of fabric in motion. One of my biggest artistic inspirations is AnnaLaura_art on Instagram. Her work never fails to spark my creativity and admiration. Whether I'm sketching for fun or refining a new piece, art is my favorite way to express myself. I also love experimenting with different styles and techniques, always pushing myself to improve and try something new. Some days, I focus on dynamic poses and anatomy, while other times, I get lost in the details of shading and textures. No matter what Iâ€™m working on, I enjoy the process just as much as the final result. Art is a journey, and every piece teaches me somethingâ€”whether itâ€™s patience, problem-solving, or simply appreciating the progress Iâ€™ve made. Itâ€™s a constant learning experience, and thatâ€™s what makes it so exciting.</p>
